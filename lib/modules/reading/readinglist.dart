  "Many creatures light up the world’s waters. From microorganisms that turn shoreline waves electric blue at night to anglerfish deep down who use glowing lures to entice prey, a varied array of marine creatures emit light in a natural phenomenon known as bioluminescence."
"Now, a new study has found the earliest example of bioluminescence yet, pushing its origins back into the earliest days of animal life. Around 540 million years ago, soft, branching animals called octocorals began to light up the oceans."
"The study, published Tuesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B by biologist and National Museum of Natural History research associate Danielle DeLeo and colleagues, uses the relationships of octocorals in our modern oceans to work backward and unravel when bioluminescence first appeared in these frond-like animals."
"In the seas today, octocorals take a variety of forms such as sea pens, sea fans and soft corals. “Octocorals are soft-bodied corals that have tree-like shapes,” DeLeo says. The creatures get their name from the symmetry of their bodies, arranged in eight parts. Often, “octocorals can create coral gardens and animal forests in the oceans, particularly in the deep sea, which can provide homes and even nursery habitats for an array of other animals,” she adds."
"Researchers focused on octocorals for the new study because most octocoral species are luminous. Just as in all bioluminescent organisms, the enzyme luciferase interacts with the compound luciferin to create light among the octocorals."
"So far, zoologists have estimated that the ability to be luminous evolved around 100 different times among animals. Exactly when living things began to bioluminesce, however, has been challenging to track. Up until now, the oldest known example of bioluminescence was in 267-million-year-old crustaceans. DeLeo and co-authors expected that the ability likely went even further back in time. Octocorals, with their many luminous species, seemed like a good group to look into for more evidence."
"“Because of their mainly soft bodies, octocorals don’t fossilize as well as the hard, stony corals,” DeLeo says. Sometimes all experts have to work with are small, hard parts of the coral structure called sclerites. The critical biochemical reaction can’t be directly observed in fossils, either, and so experts have had to rely on other lines of evidence to explore the origins of biological glow. In the case of the octocorals, looking at their family tree and where they settle down in the sea has helped DeLeo and co-authors identify when the animals began to brighten up the oceans."
"To follow the evolution of bioluminescence in octocorals, DeLeo and colleagues looked to the genetic similarities among octocorals and their relatives. The 3,500 or so species of octocorals belong to a larger group called Anthozoa that includes corals and sea anemones. The zoologists looked for which species generate biological light to determine how many times the ability evolved among the animals. “We were able to use genetic similarities to decipher the evolutionary relationships of the corals,” DeLeo says, using coral fossils to help calibrate the timeline of when the various octocoral groups appeared. The researchers also tracked the depth bioluminescent octocorals live at to work out whether emitting light evolved in the shallows or in the darker depths of the oceans. And with such an assessment of modern octocorals, the researchers estimated what the ancestral octocoral might have been like and when it lived."
"Bioluminescence is so common in octocorals, with shared biological mechanisms, that the last common ancestor of the entire group must have been bioluminescent, the researchers propose. The ancestor lived near the beginning of the Cambrian, around 542 million years ago, when life on Earth was blooming in new ways and new forms of animal were rapidly diversifying. DeLeo and colleagues also expect that the earliest glowing octocorals originated in shallow waters before later expanding into the deep sea."
"“I feel this paper presents a compelling case for one origin of bioluminescence in octocorals by the Cambrian,” says University of California, Santa Barbara, zoologist Emily Lau, who was not involved in the study. Even accounting for unknowns or groups of octocorals that bioluminescence has not been documented in yet, the available data indicates that the ability originated once in the group hundreds of millions of years ago."
"The study also raises new questions. “I’m excited about this finding,” Lau says, partly because the study reveals the puzzle of how organisms like octocorals obtain the biological compound needed to bioluminesce. Even though luminous marine organisms need a substance called coelenterazine to bioluminesce, she says, few produce it themselves. Some animals obtain it through their diet instead. In the case of the earliest octocorals, then, were the glowing fronds making their own coelenterazine, or were they consuming some other organism to obtain the needed compound? Now that the timeline for bioluminescence has been refined for the octocorals, researchers can start diving deeper into how the ability changed through the eons."
"Evolving the ability to glow in the shallows likely opened the pathway for octocorals to expand further and further into the depths with time. “The most common octocoral families found throughout the dark, deep sea are known to bioluminesce,” DeLeo says, hinting that the ability was important for the animals growing in the dark."
"Ancient octocorals likely gained bioluminescence ability because of a biological quirk. “Bioluminescent light was likely a byproduct of a more ancient antioxidant-like pathway,” DeLeo says, or the evolution of a way for animals to mitigate damage to their bodies. As the pathways evolved and became more refined, DeLeo says, circumstances still favored bioluminescence.",
"“Bioluminescence can help animals evade predation, attract prey and even communicate with other individuals,” DeLeo says. A biological quirk more than half a billion years ago would eventually have the seas glowing from the shallows to the depths.",

  //1 moonwalk
  "The first space shuttle mission of 1984, the launch of Challenger on the cool, windless morning of Friday, February 3, was apparently perfect—and eagerly trailed by a national press anticipating the first flights of what they called the “Buck Rogers jetpacks.” Formally known as the Manned Maneuvering Unit, the invention was a massive backpack equipped with gas thrusters that would allow astronauts to leave their spacecraft and float free in space for the first time in history. Reporters hoped that the spectacle would approach the theatrics of watching men walk on the moon more than a decade before. But, once in orbit, as the astronauts tackled the initial tasks of their weeklong mission, they experienced a trickle of humiliating failures: First, mission specialist Ronald E. McNair oversaw the launch of the Westar 6 communications satellite, which spun like a top out of the payload bay as planned, but then apparently vanished. Mission Control sheepishly admitted that they had simply lost it somewhere in space. “We can’t find it,” they told the astronauts over the radio link. “It’s not where it’s supposed to be.”"
"Then an experiment designed to test the shuttle’s facility for orbital rendezvous, using a Mylar balloon inflated with gas, also ended in farce when the balloon launched but promptly exploded; meanwhile, the shuttle toilet—which had always been troublesome—stopped working altogether. After waiting 48 hours to assure themselves that Palapa B-2, the second satellite due for release on the mission, would not suffer a similar fate to Westar 6, Mission Control gave the crew instructions to proceed with launching it. Seconds later, they lost contact with that, too. The total bill for the two mislaid satellites was at least \$180 million."
"By the time two men—Colonel Robert L. Stewart and Captain Bruce McCandless, one of the veteran astronauts who had signed on to NASA during the Apollo program and waited 18 years for this moment—stepped into the air lock to test the Manned Maneuvering Unit on the fifth day of the mission, NASA was desperate for good publicity."
"They were not disappointed. At 7:25 on Tuesday morning, Houston time, McCandless fired the thrusters of his jetpack, rose slowly from Challenger’s cargo bay and flew clear of the spacecraft. He ran through his flight checklist, touching the joysticks with his fingertips to verify that the pack was working as it should: “Pitch down, pitch up, roll left, roll right,” he began, enunciating each word clearly into his headset microphone. Behind him, the pack trembled and shuddered like a nervous pony as its onboard computers automatically corrected his attitude with tiny whispers of gas from its two dozen nitrogen jets. Despite all his years of training and the bitter cold inside the suit, his palms prickled with sweat; his heart quickened. “It may have been a small step for Neil,” he said, “but it’s a heck of a big leap for me.”"
"Moving backward at no more than a foot a second, to preserve valuable fuel, McCandless watched as the gulf separating him from Challenger steadily expanded. Inside his suit, it became so cold his teeth began chattering; he switched off the internal cooling unit and continued sailing out into space. He looked for stars but saw only an enveloping darkness. The astronaut held a crude range finder—an aluminum bar etched with marks against which to measure his diminishing view of the shuttle’s cargo bay—to estimate the distance from the orbiter, and make sure he didn’t stray too far. Inside the cabin, McNair stood at the controls of the shuttle’s robot arm, ready to snatch McCandless to safety if necessary, and kept a laser tracker and Challenger’s TV cameras trained on him, transmitting live pictures to Houston and television stations around the planet. Meanwhile, Stewart remained behind in the payload bay, conducting a separate series of tests."
"Still gazing back toward the shuttle, McCandless at last reached his destination and brought the jetpack’s progress to a halt: some 320 feet out in space, 170 miles above the Atlantic—a human satellite in orbit, traveling at 23 times the speed of sound. Yet the astronaut felt no sense of movement until he looked down and saw the planet rotating beneath his feet, a pin-sharp relief map unspooling at four miles per second: “Looks like Florida. It is Florida!” he said, his composure ebbing momentarily as he spotted Cape Canaveral below. “It really is beautiful.”"


"Looking out from the cockpit, pilot Robert L. “Hoot” Gibson centered the distant figure in the viewfinder of his Hasselblad—but then pulled the camera away from his eye, briefly startled by the power and clarity of the image he had framed. Gibson saw McCandless suspended alone in the abyssal blackness—angled slightly from the vertical, his white suit seeming to glow beneath the unfiltered sunlight of outer space, the luminous blue band of Earth’s atmosphere curving away beneath him. Gibson checked the settings on the camera, and then checked them again; he pointed the lens through the triple-paned cabin window and tilted it to level the horizon. He squeezed the shutter."
"Meanwhile, McCandless continued to test the abilities of his experimental flying machine: He sailed back toward Challenger and then drew away once more; he dipped and rose, and turned somersaults. Like the other astronauts before him who had spoken rapturously of walking in space—back in 1965, Ed White had been so reluctant to return to his Gemini capsule that he described doing so as “the saddest moment of my life”—McCandless had hoped, if only for a few moments, to experience the noiseless solitude of being alone in the heavens; but the relentless chatter of the three audio feeds in his headset made it impossible."
"The experimental plan had called, too, for the astronaut to orient himself to turn away from the shuttle when he reached the limit of his journey, and face out into the void. McCandless, a grizzled and shaven- headed 46-year-old third-generation Navy officer whose father and grandfather had both been awarded the Medal of Honor, was well acquainted with the limits of fear; as a Naval aviator, he had often landed his Phantom on the pitching deck of a carrier at night, and he believed that he would never do anything more dangerous. Yet, despite his intentions, not once in the entire spacewalk did he turn his back on Challenger, his sole means of returning home."
"Almost six hours after their experiment had begun, McCandless and Stewart clambered back inside the spacecraft, sealed the door of the air lock behind them and removed their helmets. Down in Mission Control, the two astronauts’ wives fell into each other’s arms and wept.",

  "Glistening in the dry expanses of the Nevada desert is an unusual kind of power plant that harnesses energy not from the sun or wind, but from the Earth itself."
"The site, known as Project Red, pumps water thousands of feet into the ground, down where rocks are hot enough to roast a turkey. Around the clock, the structure sucks the heated water back up; it is then used to power generators. Since last November, this carbon-free, Earth-borne power has been flowing onto a local grid in Nevada."
"Geothermal energy, though it’s continuously radiating from Earth’s super-hot core, has long been a relatively niche source of electricity, largely limited to volcanic regions like Iceland where hot springs bubble from the ground. But geothermal enthusiasts have dreamed of sourcing Earth power in places without such specific geological conditions—like Project Red’s Nevada site, developed by energy startup Fervo Energy."
"Such next-generation geothermal systems have been in the works for decades, but they’ve proved expensive and technologically difficult, and have sometimes even triggered earthquakes. Some experts hope that newer efforts like Project Red may now, finally, signal a turning point, by leveraging techniques that were developed in oil and gas extraction to improve reliability and cost efficiency."
"The advances have garnered hopes that with enough time and money, geothermal power—which currently generates less than 1 percent of the world’s electricity, and 0.4 percent of electricity in the United States—could become a mainstream energy source. Some posit that geothermal could be a valuable tool in transitioning the energy system off of fossil fuels, because it can provide a continuous backup to intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. “It’s been, to me, the most promising energy source for a long time,” says energy engineer Roland Horne of Stanford University. “But now that we’re moving toward a carbon-free grid, geothermal is very important.”"
"Geothermal energy works best with two things: heat, plus rock that is permeable enough to carry water. In places where molten rock sizzles close to the surface, water will seep through porous volcanic rock, warm up and bubble upward as hot water, steam or both."
"If the water or steam is hot enough—ideally at least around 300 degrees Fahrenheit—it can be extracted from the ground and used to power generators for electricity. In Kenya, nearly 50 percent of electricity generated comes from geothermal. Iceland produces 25 percent of its electricity from this source, while New Zealand makes about 18 percent and the state of California generates 6 percent."
"Some natural geothermal resources are still untapped, such as in the western U.S., says geologist Ann Robertson-Tait, president of GeothermEx, a geothermal energy consulting division at the oilfield services company SLB. But by and large, we’re running out of natural, high-quality geothermal resources, pushing experts to consider ways of extracting geothermal energy from areas where the energy is much harder to access. “There’s so much heat in the Earth,” Robertson-Tait says. But, she adds, “much of it is locked inside rock that isn’t permeable.”"
"Tapping that heat requires deep drilling and creating cracks in these non-volcanic, dense rocks to allow water to flow through them. Since 1970, engineers have been developing “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) that do just that, applying methods similar to the hydraulic fracturing—or fracking—used to suck oil and gas out of deep rocks. Water is pumped at high pressure into wells, up to several miles deep, to blast cracks into the rocks. The cracked rock and water create an underground radiator where water heats before rising to the surface through a second well. Dozens of such EGS installations have been built in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan—most of them experimental and government-funded—with mixed success."
"Famously, one EGS plant in South Korea was abruptly shuttered in 2017 after having probably caused a 5.5 magnitude earthquake; fracking of any kind can add pressure to nearby tectonic faults. Other issues were technological—some plants didn’t create enough fractures for good heat exchange, or fractures traveled in the wrong direction and failed to connect the two wells."
"Some efforts, however, turned into viable power plants, including several German and French systems built between 1987 and 2012 in the Rhine Valley. There, engineers made use of existing fractures in the rock."
"But overall, there just hasn’t been enough interest to develop EGS into a more reliable and lucrative technology, says geophysicist Dimitra Teza of the energy research institute Fraunhofer IEG in Karlsruhe, Germany, who helped develop some of the Rhine Valley EGS systems. “It has been quite tough for the industry.”"
"Solutions exist for both safety and technological problems. There are, in fact, robust protocols for avoiding earthquakes, such as by not drilling near active faults. Long-term monitoring of the operating EGS plants in France and Germany has documented only minor tremors, building confidence in the safety of the technology. Importantly, drilling and fracking methodology has improved by leaps and bounds, thanks to the boom in oil and gas extraction from shale rocks that began in the 2010s. “Since then, we’ve seen a renewed interest in EGS as a concept, because the techniques that are central to EGS were perfected and brought down significantly in cost during that time,” says Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University."
"In 2015, for instance, the U.S. Department of Energy launched a research site in Utah dedicated to advancing EGS technologies. Several new North American startups, including Sage Geosystems and E2E Energy Solutions, are developing new EGS systems in Texas and Canada, respectively. The most advanced is Fervo Energy, which has applied several techniques from the shale industry at its Nevada site; the electricity now supplies a local grid that includes energy-sucking data storage centers owned by Google. (Google partnered with Fervo to develop the plant.)"
"Engineers drilled almost 8,000 feet downward into the Nevada rock, reaching temperatures of nearly 380 degrees Fahrenheit, and then, at the bottom, drilled another 3,250-foot horizontal well to expand the area of hot rock that the system touches—a technique used in oil and gas extraction in order to maximize yield. The company also fractured the surrounding rock at several sites along the horizontal well to create a more extensive web of cracks for water to trickle through. Technologically speaking, compared to earlier EGS efforts, “they are, in fact, a big step forward,” says Horne, who is on Fervo’s scientific advisory board."
"It remains to be seen how these new EGS systems perform in the long term. One advantage of systems like Fervo’s is that they can be made more profitable by taking advantage of energy price fluctuations, according to recent research by Ricks, a Princeton colleague and several experts at Fervo Energy. Operators could plug the exit wells, causing water to accumulate inside the system, building up pressure and heat. Then the energy could be extracted during times when it is most valuable—such as during cloudy or windless periods when solar or wind aren’t working."
"Still, such systems would have to be significantly scaled up to be commercially viable, Ricks says. Although Project Red provided enough steam to generate 3.5 megawatts, enough to power more than 2,500 homes and more than any other EGS plant, it’s still relatively small; a nuclear or coal plant can easily have an output of 1,000 megawatts, while large solar or traditional geothermal plants often produce several hundred megawatts."
"What the EGS field needs right now, Ricks says, is the funding to build and test more such systems to inspire investor confidence. “This all needs to be very well proven, out to the point where the perceived risk is low,” he says."
"To that end, the U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded \$60 million in funding to three demonstration projects for EGS and related technologies as part of a broader initiative to speed up EGS development. One 2019 report from the agency estimated that, with advances in EGS, geothermal power could represent around 60 gigawatts (60,000 megawatts) of installed capacity in the U.S. by 2050, generating 8.5 percent of the country’s electricity—a more than 20-fold increase from today."
"Even an increase of a few percentage points could aid in a global energy transition that’s aiming to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “If in 15, 20 years, EGS is viable, I think it could play a huge part,” says Nils Angliviel de La Beaumelle, who recently co-wrote an article on the global outlook for renewable energy in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources."
"Other geothermal technologies may also help. Some companies are exploring the feasibility of “super hot rock” geothermal—essentially, a young, extreme variant of EGS that involves drilling down even deeper into Earth’s crust, to a depth where water reaches a “supercritical” vapor-like state that allows it to carry much more energy than either steam or liquid. In southern Germany, the energy company Eavor is building the world’s first “closed-loop” geothermal system: Once pipes funnel water into the deep rock, the system fans out into a network of parallel boreholes, without water ever penetrating the rock. That’s a more predictable—albeit less efficient—way of warming water, as it doesn’t involve uncertainties around fracturing the rock in the right way, Teza says. “I’m really excited to see that there’s investment into these technologies,” she says. “I think it can only help.”"
"On the whole, it’s an important moment for geothermal energy—and not just for providing carbon-free electricity, Robertson-Tait says. Geothermal brines hauled out of the Earth are rich in lithium and other critical minerals that can be used to build green technologies like solar panels and EV batteries. There’s a growing push to use direct geothermal heat to warm buildings, either through shallow heat pumps for residential buildings or larger systems designed for entire districts—as Paris and Munich already have."
"Some oil and gas companies, recognizing that a change is coming, are increasingly interested in building geothermal systems of various kinds, says Robertson-Tait. “Our Earth is geothermal,” she says, “and so I think we owe it to ourselves to do everything we can to use it.”"

  //3 solar
  "As a total solar eclipse darkened the sky during the afternoon of August 31, 1932, citizen scientist Joseph R. Burgess watched five hives of honeybees in Nantucket, Massachusetts."
"At first, nothing seemed odd. The bees came and went in their usual numbers. But as darkness fell, “a great roar of wings ensued,” Burgess wrote. Soon, the air was thick with honeybees, all in a “great rush” to return to their hives—with so many trying to get in that the entrances became “blocked with bees.” But roughly 20 minutes after totality, the colonies seemed to return to their usual routines. “Just the sort of flight that occurs early in the morning,” Burgess wrote."
"On that day, spurred by newspaper ads, a ragtag cohort of citizen scientists dotted the path of totality in a farming region of New England. Together, they recorded nearly 500 accounts of animal behavior and mailed them to a team of researchers led by William Morton Wheeler, an entomologist at Harvard University."
"The crowdsourced bits of data were wide-ranging and often quirky. Mosquitoes—described by observers as “annoying” and “very vicious”—started biting in the darkness of totality. Nocturnal birds such as owls and whip-poor-wills began to call. Skunks came out to forage in the dark. An eastern garter snake had “evidently been feeding actively during the eclipse,” since it appeared to have a stomach full of food. And a woman told a citizen scientist that cockroaches infested her pantry after totality."
"Each of these was just an anecdote—scientists can’t show that any one reaction was directly caused by the eclipse. And many creatures across several species didn’t seem to react at all. But during this year’s total solar eclipse on April 8, researchers will get another rare chance to explore how animals across the continent respond as they are plunged into a sudden, apparent “nighttime” in the middle of the day."
"Ancient human civilizations saw eclipses as omens—and, often, ones with foreboding and terrifying implications. Today, eclipse viewers report profound feelings of awe and connection. But humans don’t witness eclipses alone—some might go outside with their dogs, or watch the spectacle alongside wild birds, crickets, frogs or ants."
"“We ourselves are so impacted during an eclipse. Everybody I know who has been through a total eclipse has been really moved by it,” says Adam Hartstone-Rose, a biological scientist at North Carolina State University. Given how intensely our own human emotions are tied to such an event, he adds, “I think people are really interested in contemplating what must be going through the minds of the animals that they can experience this with.”"
"Despite his interest in the subject now, Hartstone-Rose initially had doubts when he led a study of animals at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, during the solar eclipse in 2017."
"“I was really skeptical. I didn’t think that animals were going to have a particularly strong reaction,” Hartstone-Rose says. After all, clouds and passing rainstorms regularly dim the sun’s light. “And animals don’t have a very strong reaction to that.”"
"Still, he stationed students across zoo exhibits of animals spanning 17 species and had them observe the creatures for two days before the eclipse and on the day of totality. To his surprise, about three-quarters of the species showed a measurable response—and, in a few cases, the animals did something completely unexpected."
"The Galápagos tortoises, which are usually very sedentary, displayed one of those unusual behaviors: “During the peak of the eclipse, they actually started mating, which was remarkable,” Hartstone-Rose says. “That was bizarre.”"
"Meanwhile, the Komodo dragon had spent the two days prior to the eclipse sitting still as a statue. “It could have been a taxidermy animal as far as we could tell,” Hartstone-Rose says. “[It] didn’t move one inch,” even on the morning of the eclipse. But once the moon blocked out the sun’s rays, the reptile moved toward the door to its indoor enclosure, which was closed, then began running around the exhibit, “almost, like, climbing the walls,” until the sun reappeared."
"Across the zoo, many other animals responded to the total eclipse, disproving Hartstone-Rose’s initial impression. Gorillas collectively approached their evening habitat. Flamingos gathered together, putting their young at the center of their huddle. Two cockatoos began touching beaks and preening each other. A sleeping tawny frogmouth—a nocturnal, “goofy little bird”—woke up and started foraging during totality as if it were nighttime, though the creatures usually just “try their best to look like a tree stump” during the day, says Hartstone-Rose."
"Some of the animals didn’t react at all or didn’t seem fazed—one bear that had been lazing around simply lifted its head a moment, then returned to sleep. And even when creatures did react, especially when they showed signs of anxiety, the eclipse might not have been the only driver of that response: Increased visitor activity at the zoo could have unsettled them, for example."
"But overall, the findings seemed clear: Many animals, like humans, appear to experience something when a total eclipse occurs."
"This result was corroborated by amateur observations from across the country during the 2017 eclipse, as part of a project called Life Responds. Within and outside the path of totality, citizen scientists snapped pictures of organisms’ reactions to the event, then uploaded them to iNaturalist’s page for the project, organized by the California Academy of Sciences."
"Countrywide, people noticed swallows and swifts flocking as darkness fell. Frogs and crickets, common elements of an evening soundscape, started to call, while diurnal cicadas stopped making noise. Ants appeared to slow down or stop moving, and even domestic chickens responded—hens gathered together and got quiet, while roosters crowed."
"One observer in Idaho found a bat that seemed to have died during totality: “My guess is that it came out during the coolness and darkness of the eclipse then got too hot when the sun quickly came out.” Another person in Oklahoma recorded that a herd of bison did not appear to react."
"A citizen scientist watched a yellow okra flower close during totality, just as it would at night—a favorite observation of Alison Young, co-director of the Center for Biodiversity and Community Science at the California Academy of Sciences and lead author of a paper describing the findings. The flower’s response was unexpected, she says in an email, since totality wasn’t very long."
"With this year’s total solar eclipse less than a week away, the Life Responds team is eager to repeat the experiment—and researchers and citizen scientists alike are gearing up to collect a new round of animal observations. This eclipse will sweep across an even wider swath of the continent than the last one did, and its different path will allow for more varied data to be collected."
"For one, totality will be nearly twice as long as it was seven years ago, which could have a stronger influence on animals, leading to more of a response. However, the April timing of this event could drive the opposite result, Young says."
"“We may see less response overall for the areas of totality that are in northern latitudes, since there’s just less plant and animal activity there this time of year, compared to the 2017 eclipse that pretty much cut through the middle of the U.S., west to east, in the height of summer,” she adds."
"Hartstone-Rose will be repeating the zoo research, this time at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas. He’ll also collect crowdsourced reports of activity during the eclipse—from wild animals to pets and livestock. “One of the questions I’m really interested in is what level of totality triggers some of these behaviors,” he says. For instance, do animals still seem to react if the sun is only 90 or 95 percent covered?"
"Likewise, the Life Responds project team is making a few tweaks to its methods this time around. In addition to collecting submissions of photos, researchers are asking citizen scientists to write a description of the behavior they experienced and encouraging collection of sound recordings. This will better capture some reactions that aren’t necessarily photographable, such as an absence of animals or stopping of behavior."
"These changes get at a fundamental truth about scientific observation that eclipses can reveal: Science is not done only through sight. And, similarly, eclipses are not just visual experiences."
"“People are often asking people, ‘Where are you going to see the eclipse?’ ‘Where are you going to watch the eclipse?’ But eclipses are actually much more than that; they’re multi-sensory experiences,” says MaryKay Severino, education director at ARISA Lab. “You can feel temperature drops, you can feel excitement, you can listen to all of the changes around you.”"
"And when it comes to animal responses to this rare celestial event, many also seem to be felt and heard. That’s why the Eclipse Soundscapes Project, led by ARISA Lab and supported by NASA, aims to capture audio recordings and multi-sensory observations from hundreds of participants across the continent. People might make a note of a specific bird call they heard—or just that they heard birds singing—and describe what the weather felt like."
"The team plans to make their dataset publicly available so that other scientists can use it to probe their own research questions. They hope to cast a wide net and gather as much input as they can, from a variety of environments—“truly everywhere,” as Severino says—even urban areas."
"Afterward, other teams might use this information to study animal reactions based on bird calls or insect sounds. But the Eclipse Soundscapes team in particular is hoping to study the noises of crickets, since they are so widespread. In Wheeler’s study of the 1932 eclipse, lots of observers noted that crickets’ chirping intensified during totality—and this year’s observations could add understanding or nuance to that trend."
"At the end of the day, however, total solar eclipses are rare. According to NASA, a total eclipse will pass over a given spot on Earth only once every 375 years, on average. If an individual animal happens to be in the path of totality on Monday, it’s probably never going to experience totality again in its lifetime. As a result, understanding how animals react to these phenomena simply doesn’t have an impact on everyday life."
"But studying how creatures respond to totality does satisfy a distinct curiosity for eclipse viewers."
"“There’s a fundamental thing about being a human where we want to answer questions about amazing things,” says Hartstone-Rose. “So that’s why this really matters.”",

  //0 footprint
  "Now, “we need lots more sites to make sense of where they came from and by what route,” says Matthew Bennett, a professor of environmental and geographical sciences at Bournemouth University in England and lead author of two scientific papers about the footprints. “The lasting legacy of White Sands is to point the way to a new archive of evidence.”"
"The footprints were made by people walking on damp ground at the edge of a lake. Some are visible to the eye; others can only be found by ground-penetrating radar. Bennett knows of older human tracks in Africa and other parts of the world, but none, he says, “tell such a vivid, relatable story.” His first paper dating these tracks detailed a perilous journey undertaken by what appears to be a small woman or adolescent female, carrying a child on her hip, walking fast across the muddy lakeshore."
"“There were hungry predators around, including dire wolves and saber-toothed cats,” says Bennett. “We can see where she slipped in the mud at certain points. … We can also see the child’s footprints where she set it down, presumably because she was tired and needed a rest.”"
"Based on the size of the footprints, it appears the child was less than 3 years old and did not accompany the older female on the return journey. Did she drop the kid off in a camp? Why were they traveling among dangerous animals on the slippery lakeshore?"
"“There’s no way of knowing,” says Bennett. “But if you’ve ever rushed to get somewhere important while carrying a tired toddler, you’ve experienced a very similar emotion”—even if you weren’t looking over your shoulder for saber-toothed cats.",

  //1 mary
  "The first woman to rule England in her own right didn’t simply inherit the throne. She seized it with unprecedented ambition from those who sought to thwart her."
"Historian Sarah Gristwood describes the ascension of Mary I as a “staggeringly bold” course of action undertaken with little chance of success. After unseating Lady Jane Grey, the Nine-Day Queen, Mary rode into London on August 3, 1553, to widespread acclaim. In the words of one contemporary chronicler, “It was said that no one could remember there ever having been public rejoicing such as this.”"
"Centuries later, however, the Tudor queen is remembered as one of the most reviled figures in English history: “Bloody Mary.” This is the story of how a heroic underdog became a monarch who was then mythologized as a violent despot, despite being no bloodier than her father, Henry VIII, or many other English monarchs. It’s a tale of sexism, shifting national identity and good old-fashioned propaganda, all of which coalesced to create the image of an unchecked tyrant that endures today."
"Born on February 18, 1516, Mary was not the long-awaited son her parents, Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, had hoped for. But she survived infancy and grew up in the public eye as a beloved princess—at least until her teenage years, when her father’s infatuation with Anne Boleyn led him to divorce her mother and break with the Catholic Church. Declared illegitimate, downgraded from the title of “princess” to “lady” and separated from her mother, Mary refused to acknowledge the validity of her parents’ divorce or her father’s status as head of the Church of England. It was only in 1536, after Anne’s execution and Henry’s marriage to Jane Seymour, that Mary finally agreed to her mercurial father’s terms."
"Welcomed back to court, she survived Henry—and three more stepmothers—only to see her younger half-brother, Edward VI, take the throne in 1547 as a Protestant reformer, adopting a stance anathema to her fervent Catholicism. When Edward died six years later, in 1553, he attempted to subvert his father’s wishes by leaving the crown to a Protestant cousin, Jane, excluding those next in line in the succession: Mary and her younger half-sister, the future Elizabeth I. Though Mary could have sought refuge with relatives in Spain, she chose to remain in England and fight for what was rightfully hers. Eluding the armies of her antagonists, she rallied support from nobles across the country and marched on London. Mary and Elizabeth rode into England’s capital side by side, one as a queen and the other as a queen-in-waiting."
"During her five-year reign, Mary navigated the manifold challenges associated with her status as the first English queen to wear the crown in her own right, rather than as the wife of a king. She prioritized religion, implementing reforms and restrictions aimed at restoring the Catholic Church’s ascendancy in England. Most controversially, she ordered around 280 Protestants burned at the stake as heretics—a fact that would later cement her reputation as “Bloody Mary.”"
"The queen also set precedents and laid the groundwork for initiatives that would be built upon by her much-lauded successor, Elizabeth—among others, financial reform, exploration and naval expansion. But Mary failed to fulfill arguably the most important duty of any monarch: producing an heir. When she died at age 42 in 1558 of an ailment alternatively identified as uterine cancer, ovarian cysts or influenza, Elizabeth claimed the throne."
"Prior to England’s break from Rome in 1534, Catholicism had dominated the realm for centuries. Henry VIII’s decision to form the Church of England proved predictably contentious, as evidenced by the 1536 Pilgrimage of Grace uprising, which found some 30,000 Northerners taking up arms in protest of the dissolution of the monasteries, banning of feasts and holy days, and violent treatment of clergy who refused to accept the new order. Under Henry’s son, Edward, the English Reformation reached new extremes, with legislation allowing priests to marry, ending the practice of Latin Mass, and discouraging the veneration of relics and religious artifacts."
"According to Linda Porter, author of The Myth of “Bloody Mary,” Edward “moved much faster and much further than the majority of the population wanted, … remov[ing] a great deal that was familiar and depriv[ing] the congregation of what many of them saw as the mystery and beauty of the experience of worship.” Protestantism, she says, was the “religion of an educated minority,” not a universally adopted doctrine. At its core, Porter and other historians have suggested, England was still a fundamentally Catholic country when Mary took the throne."
"An ardent Catholic herself, Mary was measured in her initial attempts to restore the old church. But as historian Alison Weir writes in The Children of Henry VIII, these initiatives grew more controversial following the queen’s marriage to Philip II of Spain in July 1554, at which point they were “associated in the public mind with Spanish influence.” During the first year of Mary’s reign, many prominent Protestants fled abroad, but those who stayed behind—and persisted in publicly proclaiming their beliefs—became targets of heresy laws that carried a brutal punishment: burning at the stake."
"Such a death was an undoubtedly horrific sentence. But in Tudor England, bloody punishments were the norm, with execution methods ranging from beheading to boiling to being hanged, drawn and quartered. “They lived in a brutal age,” Porter says, “… and it took a lot to revolt your average 16th-century citizen.”"
"During the early modern period, Catholics and Protestants alike believed heresy warranted the heavy sentence it carried. Mary’s most famous victim, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, was preparing to enact similar policies targeting Catholics before being sidelined by Edward’s death. According to Gristwood’s Game of Queens: The Women Who Made 16th-Century Europe, “That obdurate heretics who refused to recant should die was an all but universal tenet.”"
"To the 16th-century mind, heresy was a contagion that threatened not just the church but also the stability of society as a whole. Heretics were deemed guilty of treason, as questioning a monarch’s established religious policies was tantamount to rejecting their divinely ordained authority. The justification for one heretic’s death, writes Virginia Rounding in The Burning Time: Henry VIII, Bloody Mary and the Protestant Martyrs of London, was the “salvation of many innocent Christians, who might otherwise have been led astray.” Even the gruesome method of execution had an underlying purpose: Death at the stake gave recalcitrant heretics a taste of hellfire, offering them one final chance to recant and save their souls."
"Mary and her advisers hoped the initial spate of burnings would serve as a “short, sharp shock” warning errant Protestants to return to the fold of the “true” faith. As the queen explained, executions should be “so used that the people might well perceive them not to be condemned without just occasion, whereby they shall both understand the truth and beware to do the like.” But Mary had grossly underestimated Protestants’ tenacity—and their willingness to die for the cause."
"“In mid-16th-century Europe,” writes Porter in her biography of Mary, “the idea of respecting another person’s beliefs would have provoked incredulity. Such certainties bred oppressors and those who were willing to be sacrificed.”"
"All that said, inextricable from Mary’s legacy are the 280 Protestants she consigned to the flames. These executions—the main reason for her unfortunate nickname—are cited as justification for labeling her one of the most evil humans of all time and even depicting her as a flesh-eating zombie. They are the impetus for the image of a monarch whose “raging madness and open tyranny,” as described by 16th-century writer Bartholomew Traheron, led her to “swimmeth in the holy blood of most innocent, virtuous and excellent personages.”"
"Consider, however, the following: Even though Mary’s father, Henry, only had 81 people burned at the stake over the course of his 38-year reign, heresy was far from the sole charge that warranted execution in Tudor England. Estimates suggest Henry ordered the deaths of as many as 57,000 to 72,000 of his subjects—including two of his wives—though it’s worth noting these figures are probably exaggerated. Mary’s brother, Edward, had two radical Protestant Anabaptists burned at the stake during his six-year reign; in 1549, he sanctioned the suppression of the Prayer Book Rebellion, resulting in the deaths of up to 5,500 Catholics. Mary’s successor, Elizabeth, burned five Anabaptists at the stake during her 45-year reign; ordered the executions of around 800 Catholic rebels implicated in the 1569 Rising of the North; and had at least 183 Catholics, the majority of whom were Jesuit missionaries, hanged, drawn and quartered as traitors."
"If numbers are the main reasoning behind such sobriquets as “Bloody Mary,” then why aren’t Mary’s family members dubbed “Bloody Henry,” “Bloody Edward” and “Bloody Bess”? Why has the myth of “Bloody Mary” persisted in Great Britain’s collective imagination for so long? And what did Mary do that was so different from not only other Tudor monarchs but also other kings and queens across early modern Europe?"
"These questions are complex and predictably fraught. But several recurring themes persist. As England’s first queen regnant, Mary faced the same challenge experienced by female rulers across the continent—namely, her councilors’ and subjects’ lack of faith in women’s ability to govern, a dilemma best summarized by contemporary Mary of Hungary: “A woman is never feared or respected as a man is, whatever her rank. … All she can do is shoulder the responsibility for the mistakes committed by others.”"
"Lucy Wooding, a historian at the University of Oxford, says descriptions of Mary tend to have misogynistic undertones. “She’s simultaneously being lambasted for being vindictive and fierce” and “spineless and weak,” criticized for such actions as showing clemency to political prisoners and yielding authority to her husband, Philip. Most experts agree that the Spanish marriage had an adverse effect on Mary’s reputation, painting her, however unfairly, as an infatuated, weak-willed woman who placed earthly love ahead of the welfare of her country."
"As Porter explains, marriage was a complicated issue for queen regnants, who “were damned if they did and damned if they didn’t.” Mary and Elizabeth exemplify both sides of this dilemma. The former, who chose to wed a prince next in line for the Spanish throne instead of one of her own subjects, avoided elevating any of England’s noble families above the others but raised fears of ceding too much authority to the far more powerful Habsburg Empire. Additionally, writes Weir, Mary “underestimated the insularity and xenophobia of her subjects, who … had heard terrible tales of the tortures of the dreaded [Spanish] Inquisition.”"
"Elizabeth, on the other hand, never wed, perpetually playing the game of courtly love and ensuring power stayed in her hands alone. Though she eventually won acclaim as England’s “virgin queen,” her decision to remain unmarried—and her constant prevarication on the subject—infuriated her advisers, who believed women were unfit to rule without the guiding influence of a husband. When Elizabeth died childless in 1603, leaving the crown to James VI of Scotland, the son of her longtime rival Mary, Queen of Scots, she effectively ended the Tudor dynasty after just three generations."
"While Elizabeth’s marital status is viewed as one of her greatest strengths, Mary’s is often cited as a sign of weakness. Popular lore suggests Mary, who was 38 years old at the time of her wedding to Philip, became besotted with her 27-year-old husband, who was in turn disgusted by his aging wife. A phantom pregnancy failed to help matters, deeply embarrassing both would-be parents and leaving the kingdom doubtful of Mary’s ability to produce an heir. A year into the marriage, Philip left England to fulfill his duties back on the continent—an act widely described as abandonment but, in truth, an anticipated arrangement necessitated by the Spaniard’s status as the prince (and soon-to-be king) of an entirely different nation."
"Porter points out that scholars know very little about the true nature of the couple’s relationship, as their surviving correspondence focuses mainly on issues of state. “Given the fact that they both had similar cultural interests and both wanted to make the marriage work for the benefit of their countries,” she says, “they probably did get along tolerably well, but we don’t know how she felt about him on a personal level, and we know very little of how he felt about her.”"
"While Mary’s gender played a pivotal role in the formation of her image—especially during her own lifetime, says Porter—arguably the most important factor in the “Bloody Mary” moniker’s staying power was the rise of a national English identity built on the rejection of Catholicism. A 1563 book by John Foxe, known popularly as Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, contributed to the creation of this Protestant identity, detailing the torments suffered by men and women burned at the stake during Mary’s reign through word-of-mouth accounts and visceral woodcut illustrations. (The accuracy of Foxe’s manuscript remains a point of contention among historians.) The book was enormously popular during the Elizabethan era, with copies even placed in local churches alongside the Bible."
"“Foxe’s account would shape the popular narrative of Mary’s reign for the next 450 years,” writes Anna Whitelock in Mary Tudor: England’s First Queen. “Generations of schoolchildren would grow up knowing the first queen of England only as ‘Bloody Mary,’ a Catholic tyrant.”"
"Porter argues that Mary’s burnings might have become a “mere footnote to history” if not for Foxe’s intervention; historian O.T. Hargrave, meanwhile, describes the persecution as “unprecedented” and suggests it “succeeded only in alienating much of the country.” Either way, after taking the throne, Elizabeth took care not to replicate her sister’s religious policies. Writing in Mary Tudor, Judith M. Richards observes, “It may have helped protect Elizabeth’s reputation that many [of the executed] … were hanged as seditious traitors for seeking to restore Catholicism rather than burned as heretics.”"
"To put it bluntly, says Porter, “Mary burned Protestants, [and] Elizabeth disemboweled Catholics. It’s not pretty either way.”"
"The myth of “Bloody Mary” is one mired in misconception. England’s first queen regnant was not a vindictive, violent woman, nor a pathetic, lovestruck wife who would have been better off as a nun. She was stubborn, inflexible and undoubtedly flawed, but she was also the product of her time, as incomprehensible to modern minds as our world would be to hers. She paved the way for her sister’s reign, setting precedents Elizabeth never acknowledged stemmed from her predecessor, and accomplished much in the arenas of fiscal policy, religious education and the arts."
"If she had lived longer, Mary might have been able to institute the religious reforms she so strongly believed in, from a renewed emphasis on preaching, education and charity to a full reunion with Rome, says Gristwood. Because Mary died just five years after her accession, however, Elizabeth inherited the throne and set England on a Protestant path. Over the centuries, most significantly in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Protestantism became a core component of British identity."
"Mary’s reputation, says Wooding, was “very painstakingly constructed after her death [and] had extraordinary longevity because of the fundamental place that Protestant identity came to take in British identity.” Her enduring unpopularity, then, reflects a failure to properly contextualize her reign: As historian Thomas S. Freeman writes, “Mary has continually been judged by the standards of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, and not surprisingly, has been found wanting.”"
"For all her faults, and regardless of whether one falls into the competing camps of rehabilitation or vilification, Mary—the first to prove women could rule England with the same authority as men—holds a singular place in British history."
"“She was an intelligent, politically adept and resolute monarch who proved to be very much her own woman,” writes Whitelock. “Mary was the Tudor trailblazer, a political pioneer whose reign redefined the English monarchy.”"
"As John White, the Bishop of Winchester, observed during Mary’s December 1558 funeral sermon, “She was a king’s daughter, she was a king’s sister, she was a king’s wife. She was a queen, and by the same title a king also.”",

"Throughout the National Gallery’s 200-year history, the London museum’s collection has served as both a cultural touchstone and a flashpoint for political swirl. In 1914, suffragist Mary Richardson strode into the gallery with a meat cleaver and slashed Diego Velázquez’s depiction of a mirrored nude woman, The Toilet of Venus (also called the Rokeby Venus), to protest the arrest of a fellow activist. During World War II, the gallery hid its masterpieces in Welsh mines for safekeeping, leaving a rotating “picture of the month” as a cultural reprieve for a bombed and battered London. Nearly 80 years later, in 2020, the gallery closed for an unprecedented 111 days, shifting, like other museums, to digital outreach amid the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"As the gallery prepares to celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding on May 10, 1824, it’s worth reflecting on a broader question: What gives a national gallery of paintings—whether it’s the London museum, the National Gallery of Art in the United States or the National Gallery of Australia—such significance, and why does this type of collection matter today?"
"The United Kingdom’s National Gallery is “a free, current and constant reference point,” says Martin Caiger-Smith, head of the master’s program in curating at the London-based Courtauld Institute of Art. “It’s a voice of authority, for better or worse.” The gallery houses around 2,300 Western European paintings spanning the 13th to early 20th centuries, a collection that has historically reflected—and shaped—the canonical tradition of Western art history."
"In the late 18th century, a trio of aristocratic collectors known as the Bridgewater Syndicate spurred a fervor for classical Western European art in the U.K. The syndicate’s profitable public exhibitions laid the groundwork for a permanent national institution that would continue to promote this shared visual idiom in art history."
"“The National Gallery has held a special place in British history and culture for 200 years,” says the museum’s director, Gabriele Finaldi. “It was established specifically to create a collection of the best possible art for the enjoyment of the entire British public, for free.”"
"The gallery opened in London’s Pall Mall area in 1824, in the former townhouse of banker John Julius Angerstein. The government had purchased 38 paintings from Angerstein’s private collection, which were soon augmented by works from other collectors."
"“Old Masters” like Titian, Raphael and Anthony van Dyck formed the majority of the gallery’s founding collection. But “from the very beginning, it [housed] British [and] contemporary art,” too, says Christine Riding, the gallery’s director of collections and research. “The longer history of the National Gallery shows you just how much people really grappled with the notion of, ‘If you’re a “national” gallery, should you just have national art?’ Or can you … be national in the sense of being a center of excellence and a center of human endeavor and creativity?”"
"The gallery’s initial ethos was informed by the era in which it was founded. “Like most national galleries, it was born of that early 19th-century sense of nationhood” that developed in Europe, says Caiger-Smith. That nationalism grew in the U.K. alongside an industrializing, urbanizing population. Its educational aims were spurred by “top-down” philanthropy—including the concept of making fine art freely available to the public—that aimed to address widening economic and social gaps."
"National competitiveness also came into play. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Riding explains, there was “a sense of slight embarrassment that the United Kingdom, despite having come out of the war … one of the wealthiest nations in the world, didn’t have the kind of provision that other [European] countries had” for publicly accessible art."
"Unlike many European national collections, the London gallery was created through an “act of Parliament as the nation’s gallery, rather than [as] a nationalized royal collection,” says Riding. “To have something that from the very beginning was developed specifically for the public and collected for the public is actually a really good message in the 21st century.”"
"Other democratic, formerly colonized countries followed the U.K.’s lead in establishing free institutions in their capital cities—albeit with collections that have centered more closely around emerging ideas of national identity. The National Gallery of Canada was established in 1880, creating a wide-ranging collection that today highlights Indigenous and Canadian art. The National Gallery of Australia’s extensive, global holdings include the world’s largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art."
"Though Australia’s national collection originated in the 1910s, the gallery’s establishment took a back seat to other political priorities until 1967, and the building was only completed—and dedicated by Elizabeth II—in 1982. Located in Canberra’s Parliamentary Triangle, on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, it occupies a prominent position comparable to the U.S. National Gallery of Art’s prime location on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., a short stroll from the Capitol building."
"The Washington gallery, established in 1937 through the donation of industrialist art collector Andrew Mellon and a joint resolution of Congress, provides another example of the ties between art, money and politics. It supplanted the previous “National Gallery of Art” that formed part of the varied holdings of the Smithsonian Institution and evolved into today’s Smithsonian American Art Museum. The U.S. collection—which is not part of the Smithsonian—centers European and American art. Its Neoclassical architecture evokes the same humbling, powerful motifs as the U.K. gallery, with a similar Grecian portico, central cupola and extended wings."
"Angerstein’s townhouse could hardly compete with other national museums like France’s palatial Louvre, so Parliament agreed to fund a new home for the gallery. The imposing Neoclassical building seen today opened in Trafalgar Square in 1838. Its central London location—between the wealthy West End and underprivileged East End—was chosen to reinforce the idea of the gallery’s public, cross-class accessibility. The London gallery’s “popularity was almost immediate, and certainly by the 1850s, it was getting about a million visitors a year,” Caiger-Smith says."
"In the decades since, the gallery’s prominence has been bolstered by the location and its symbolism. When the museum was founded, Trafalgar “was a very populist area,” Caiger-Smith says, and “the site of key public events and protests. In some ways, it still is.” London Pride and various protests march through the square today."
"By extension, the gallery’s collection has also become a target for activists. Richardson set a precedent for painting-based protests that has continued into the present. In 1961, retired bus driver Kempton Bunton confessed to stealing a Francisco Goya portrait as an objection to retirees having to pay BBC television license fees, in an almost too-good-to-be-true story that was dramatized in the 2020 film The Duke. In 1987, Robert Cambridge shot at a Leonardo da Vinci drawing to express his dismay with “political, social and economic conditions in Britain.”"
"More recently, in 2022, environmental campaigners from Just Stop Oil threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers and glued their hands to the frame of John Constable’s The Hay Wain, returning in 2023 to attack the protective glass of the Rokeby Venus with hammers. The gallery’s art has served as a high-profile target for these disparate issues because of its national—and now global—recognition."
"While the collection has served as a canvas for protest, it has equally been a source of inspiration, especially during times of upheaval. Despite evacuating much of its art to the cavernous Manod slate quarry during World War II, the gallery’s remaining “picture of the month” and popular lunchtime concert program earned public acclaim. A 1942 letter published in the London Times explained the offerings’ symbolism: “Because London’s face is scarred and bruised these days, we need more than ever to see beautiful things.”"
"The gallery also hosted contemporary exhibitions of war artists like Paul Nash, Henry Moore and Eric Ravilious. The museum’s wartime role “underlines how an institution like ours could actually be a real focus for culture and society,” Riding says, exemplifying its method of “bringing people together … galvanizing them and supporting them in a very positive way.”"
"“There’s a considerable loyalty to it,” Caiger-Smith says. After the museum closed during the Covid-19 pandemic, “the response we got from people when they were able to come again to the gallery was really moving,” Riding says. “It really showed that we did matter, and that people … wanted to come back.” Annual visitors numbered around six million pre-pandemic, returning to three million in 2023 after a steep drop in 2022."
"The way the collection is shared and received by that audience is constantly changing. “How you represent the national story, or national stories, in an era of globalization … needs to be rethought and re-presented all the time,” Caiger-Smith says. Like many other U.K. museums, the gallery is in the process of “negotiating its past,” investigating the “the legacy of slave ownership [and] questioning where its collectors, its donors, its trustees got their money,” he adds."
"Beyond this postcolonial shift, scholars are reconsidering the diversity and depth of national collections and their relationship to the art historical canon. National galleries “are seen to be central to upholding the canon, or what is important in art. That’s something which is increasingly under scrutiny … with ideas of opening up the canon and exploding the canon,” Caiger-Smith says. But change can come slower for a national institution: Consider, for instance, the London gallery’s acquisition of a single piece by George Bellows in 2014, the first major American painting to join its collections. “Those are quite radical moves for a historic collection of European painting,” the academic adds. “You move from where you are.”"
"According to Caiger-Smith, the gallery’s “great challenge is to remain relevant while its collection increasingly is seen to be centered in the past,” and to figure out “how you take the past into the future, particularly at a time when you might say, arguably, that white, European collections are seen by many, particularly the young, as less and less central, less and less relevant, even. How do you keep [it] contemporary?”"
"The gallery has continually navigated the malleable boundaries of its collections, categorizations and hierarchies in tandem with other U.K. institutions. In 1996, the gallery and the Tate Modern museum agreed that the former would collect paintings created up to 1900, while Tate would house modern and contemporary works. But history and modernity are not static categories: “Every year, [1900] gets that little bit further [into] the past,” Caiger-Smith points out."
"Riding sees a kind of symbiotic relationship between contemporary and historic art in the national collection. “All art was contemporary,” she says, and soon becomes historic. “No matter how cutting-edge [J.M.W.] Turner thought he was in his own lifetime … we now see him very much as a historical artist.” Though the gallery does not acquire contemporary art for its permanent collection, it has sponsored contemporary artist residencies since the 1980s."
"“You underestimate at your peril how important contemporary artists have been” to the gallery’s history, Riding says. “So many of them were directors and forged the way that the National Gallery developed really for the first 80 years of its existence.” The curator adds that artists have also influenced the gallery’s collection through the donation of their own works, “in order to insert themselves into the grand narrative of Western painting.”"
"The museum has further aimed to contemporize its collection through digital access and social media, the demands of which have accelerated museums’ public-facing duties over the past few decades. “I’d argue that the National Gallery has been one of the most innovative of England's national museums in recent years in sharing its collection both digitally and physically,” and in how it presents its exhibitions, says Maxwell Blowfield, author of the Maxwell Museums newsletter. The gallery has “gone far in ridding [itself] of an image of being a bit traditional and a bit stuffy. … If that shows other big institutions they, too, can be more nimble and more fun, then that’s a good thing.”"
"On May 10, the gallery will celebrate its bicentenary and evince its evolution into a contemporary model for what a museum can offer the public—even with a traditional collection. Plans for the bicentenary include mounting 12 displays of the gallery’s “National Treasures” across the U.K., taking significant works in the collection beyond the locus of London to reach the broader population."
"“Public ownership and access to world-class paintings and art is just as vitally important now for a thriving civic society as it was in 1824, and these fundamental principles of excellence and access are still what guide us today,” says Finaldi, the museum director. To mark the anniversary, the gallery will also host a series of contemporary performance art events staged by Jeremy Deller, bolster online research and accessibility to its collections, create educational programs, and present exhibitions on van Gogh and 14th-century Sienese painting, culminating in an ambitious rehang of the permanent collection in 2025."
"“Two hundred years later, we do things a little differently,” Finaldi says. “Key to this is that, although we are very proud to welcome millions of people each year to Trafalgar Square, we no longer expect everyone to have to come to us in order to discover the power of art. Our paintings are owned just as much by those in the U.K. who can’t visit Trafalgar Square as those who come to see their favorite painting every week.”"
"The director adds, “We continue to seek new ways to bring the experience of seeing and understanding great paintings to as many people as possible, through digital channels and also through an intense engagement with contemporary artists.”"
"Though the gallery’s approach may look different, its purpose remains constant. “Why people felt it was so important to [have a national gallery] 200 years ago is often the answer as to why it’s important now,” Riding says, “because in essence it’s all about … learning, creativity and engaging” people with art. Today, a national gallery is an ever-evolving space to preserve and interact with beauty, history, hierarchy, influence and power.",
